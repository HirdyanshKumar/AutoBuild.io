🚀 AI-Powered App Builder — Project Roadmap

🧩 Overview

We’re building a full-stack AI-powered website builder that generates complete applications from simple prompts using AI agents, background jobs, and sandboxed execution.

🧱 1️⃣ Setup & Architecture

🎯 Goal: Define architecture and connect core tools.

🧠 Tech Stack:

Next.js 15 + React 19 → Frontend framework and SSR

Tailwind v4 + Shadcn/UI → Responsive, modern UI design

tRPC → Type-safe API communication

Prisma + Neon → Database ORM + Serverless MySQL

Clerk → Authentication and billing system

Inngest → Background job orchestration + AI agents

E2B + Docker → Secure sandbox for executing generated code

CodeRabbit → AI-powered pull request (PR) reviews

AI Models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok) → Core intelligence for code generation

🎨 2️⃣ Frontend Development

🎯 Goal: Build a clean, interactive dashboard and prompt UI.

🧰 Tasks:

Design Landing Page with authentication

Build Dashboard with sidebar navigation

Add Prompt Input UI for generating apps

Integrate Live Preview and Code Explorer

Display Credit and Usage Information

🤖 3️⃣ AI Agent Integration

🎯 Goal: Generate full-stack code from user prompts.

🧰 Tasks:

Configure Inngest agents to process prompts asynchronously

Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, and Grok APIs for code generation

Generate frontend, backend, and database code snippets

Execute results securely using E2B Sandboxes

💾 4️⃣ Database & API Layer

🎯 Goal: Store user data and manage app generation records.

🧰 Tasks:

Design Prisma models (User, Project, CreditUsage)

Create tRPC APIs for project management, credits, and previews

Connect Prisma with Neon Database

🔐 5️⃣ Authentication & Billing

🎯 Goal: Manage users and control AI generation limits.

🧰 Tasks:

Implement Clerk Auth (Sign-in, Sign-up, Forgot Password)

Add Billing Plans and credit-based generation system

Track usage through Prisma database

🧱 6️⃣ Sandbox Execution & Live Previews

🎯 Goal: Let users run and test their AI-generated apps.

🧰 Tasks:

Use E2B Cloud Sandboxes to execute generated code safely

Connect Docker templates for various app types

Generate and display Preview URLs inside the dashboard

🧑‍💻 7️⃣ Git Integration & AI Code Reviews

🎯 Goal: Maintain version control and ensure quality.

🧰 Tasks:

Push generated code to GitHub repositories

Use CodeRabbit for AI-based PR reviews and feedback

🚀 8️⃣ Deployment & Monitoring

🎯 Goal: Deploy production app and monitor performance.

🧰 Tasks:

Deploy with Vercel (frontend + server functions)

Monitor Inngest job performance and runtime logs

Track user activity and app health metrics

🧪 9️⃣ Testing & Documentation

🎯 Goal: Finalize and polish the project.

🧰 Tasks:

Run integration tests across AI workflows and sandbox executions

Write clear developer & user documentation

Prepare final demo presentation
